# studentGrade_Prediction_MLProject
This machine learning model predicts the final grade of students based on several factors.
There are several factors listed in the CSV file such as midterm exam results, mother's job, father's job, how many hours the student has studies, etc.
Based on these factors, a linear regression model will predict the final grade of the student.
